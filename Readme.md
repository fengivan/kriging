A kriging tool using the exponential variogram model. Simply enter in your model parameters for sill and range (c and a), click to create points on the 800x800 grid, and enter in the values at those points. A heat map will be generated, with red representing the maximum of the values, white the average of the values, and blue representing the minimum of the values. The krigged value at your current mouse position will also be calculated and shown. Another map will be generated by the side with the minimum error variance, with black representing the smallest estimation variance and white representing the largest estimation variance.
